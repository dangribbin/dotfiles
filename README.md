dotfiles
========

This is my minimal dotfiles setup. Almost all of this has been plucked from one of the following repos:
- https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles
- https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles
- https://github.com/cowboy/dotfiles

.bash_profile includes a reference to a .privalias file that holds some aliases that are specific to my dev environment/work projects, so I don't commit that here.
